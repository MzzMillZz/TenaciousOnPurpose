<p><center>Welcome to Tenacious On Purpose. A website dedicated to helping  minority women on the journey of pursing their purpose by giving them the tools, resources, and examples that will help you stay motivated, encouraged and intentional about your purpose.</center></p>


<p><h2> What is a Tenacious Woman?</h2>

As women we have many roles and responsibilies that require so much of us mentally, spiritually, and physically. Sometimes the pressures can become too much and you need a place to encourage, motivate and rejuvenate yourself to stay on the path of pursuing your purpose. One day I was researching words that described actions, to create my visionboard. I found the word Tenacious. 

Tenacious is defined as: tending to keep a firm hold of something; clinging or adhering closely, or
persisting in existence; not easily dispelled.

This website has been created on purpose, to help you fullfill your purpose, intentionally, and tenaciously. 

Lets get ready to start this journey! <center><img src="/D:\IMED1316\images/chess.jpg" alt="chess" style="width:640px;height:437px;"></center></p>
